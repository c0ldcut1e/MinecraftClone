# MinecraftClone
A project I'm working on for fun to recreate some sort of Minecraft game inside C++ using OpenGL.
I'm making this on Arch Linux in Hyprland so this will most likely not instantly compile anywhere else or work in general anywhere else due to the environment being very different from most.
